# Crash Course on Regression Analysis

## Concept 1: Linear Regression Basics

Linear regression is a statistical algorithm we use to model the relationship between a dependent variable *y* and one or more independent variables *x*

### Singular Linear Regression
For a single independent variable, the model is:

\[y = β_0 + β_1x_1 + \epsilon\]

Where:
- \( β_0 \) = the intercept of the regression line.
- \( β_1 \) = the slope of the regression line.
- \( \epsilon \) = the error term capturing deviations from the model.

### Multiple Linear Regression
For multiple independent variables, the model generalizes to:

\[y = β_0 + β_1x_1 + β_2x_2 + \dots + β_nx_n + \epsilon\]

Here, \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \) are the predictors, and \( β_1, β_2, \dots, β_n \) are their corresponding coefficients.
